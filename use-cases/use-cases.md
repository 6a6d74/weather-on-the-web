## Use Case - Simple point data
Web application developers require convenient and consistent interface to request weather data for a specified point on the surface of the earth. The encoding format should also be consistent to enable data to be sourced from a range of weather sources.

## Use Case - Time series of point data
 
## Use Case - Drone pilot
